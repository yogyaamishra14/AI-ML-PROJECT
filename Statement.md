# Project Statement

## 1. Project Title
Student Academic Performance Prediction and Study Recommendation System

## 2. Problem Statement
Academic performance is influenced by multiple factors such as attendance, subject understanding, study hours, past marks, internal assessments, and participation in academic activities. Many students often fail to identify early indicators of low performance and lack personalized academic guidance. This leads to poor results in final examinations and a decline in overall learning outcomes. Therefore, there is a need for a system that can predict student performance using data-driven insights and provide study recommendations for improvement.

## 3. Scope of the Project
This project focuses on:
- Collecting and preprocessing student performance data
- Extracting important academic and behavioral features
- Training machine learning models to predict future academic performance
- Generating personalized study recommendations based on prediction output
- Displaying results in an easy-to-understand dashboard format

## 4. Objectives
- To analyze student datasets using statistical and visualization techniques
- To predict academic performance using machine learning algorithms
- To map prediction results to customized study guidance
- To support early intervention for at-risk students

## 5. Target Users
- Students
- Teachers and mentors
- Academic departments
- Institutional administrators

## 6. Significance of the Project
The project helps students understand their strengths and weaknesses much earlier rather than waiting for final exam results. Predictive modeling allows institutions to identify at-risk learners and provide timely academic support. Personalized recommendations enhance the learning experience and promote self-improvement. This system supports a data-driven academic environment and strengthens decision-making in education.

## 7. Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project has been *provided by the college* and contains confidential student details. Therefore, the dataset is not publicly shared in the repository.
